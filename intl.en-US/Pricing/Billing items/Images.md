# Images

This topic describes the billing methods of images and provides examples of how to calculate image fees.

## Overview

You may be charged for images that you use. The following table describes the billing details for different types of images.

|Type|Billing description|
|----|-------------------|
|Public image|Public images are provided by Alibaba Cloud and are billed based on the operating system.-   Windows Server: The price is subject to the instance type that you choose. The price information is displayed on the buy page when you create an instance.
-   Red Hat Enterprise Linux: The price information of the image is displayed on the buy page when you create an instance.
-   Public images that run other operating systems are free of charge. |
|Custom image|Custom images are created from instances or snapshots, or imported from your local device. The billing involves the following two parts:

-   Snapshot fee: A snapshot is automatically generated when you create a custom image. You are charged for the snapshot if you retain the custom image. The snapshot is billed based on the storage space it occupies. For more information, see[Snapshot billing](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing items/Snapshot billing.md).
-   Image fee: If you use a custom image derived from a paid image, you are still be charged for the source paid image.

For example, assume that Instance A is created from Paid Image A. You create a custom image from Instance A and then you create an instance from the custom image. You must pay for Paid Image A in addition to the snapshot fee. |
|Shared image|Shared images are shared with you by other Alibaba Cloud accounts. If a shared image is derived from a paid image, you are charged for the source paid image when you use the shared image.

For example, assume that you use a paid image that is shared with you by another user to create an instance. You must pay for the source paid image. |
|Alibaba Cloud Marketplace image|Alibaba Cloud Marketplace images are provided by independent software vendors \(ISVs\). The prices are shown on the buy page of Alibaba Cloud Marketplace images.|

## Billing methods

You must select an ECS image when you create an instance. The billing method and billing cycle of the image are the same as those of the instance.

|Billing method|Billing rule|Reference|
|--------------|------------|---------|
|Subscription|The billing method of the image is the same as that of the instance. Price = Unit price of the image × Subscription duration|[Subscription](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing methods/Subscription.md)|
|Pay-as-you-go|The billing method of the image is the same as that of the instance. Price = Unit price of the image × Billing duration The billing cycle is accurate to the second.|[Pay-as-you-go](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing methods/Pay-as-you-go.md)|

**Note:** Images can be used only along with ECS instances. Prices of Windows reserved instances include the prices of images and Windows reserved instances can be used to offset image bills.

## Billing examples

The following table lists examples of how to calculate image fees. Assume that you purchase an image that contains the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1 64-bit operating system in the China \(Hangzhou\) region.

**Note:** The prices in the following table are for reference only and the prices on the Pricing tab of Elastic Compute Service page prevails.

|Billing method|Billing condition|Price \(USD\)|
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
|Subscription|-   Unit price of the image: USD 43.00/month
-   Subscription duration: one month

|43.00 × 1 = 43.00|
|Pay-as-you-go|-   Unit price of the image: USD 0.089/hour
-   Billing duration: one month

|0.089 × 24 × 30 = 64.08|
