## hfc7, compute optimized instance family with high clock speed

Features

-   Uses the third-generation X-Dragon architecture to provide predictable and consistent high performance and reduce virtualization overheads.
-   I/O optimized.
-   Supports enhanced SSDs \(ESSDs\) and provides ultra-high I/O performance.
-   Provides high storage I/O performance based on large computing capacity.

    **Note:** For more information about the storage I/O performance of the new generation of enterprise-level instance families, see [Storage I/O performance](/intl.en-US/Block Storage/Performance/Storage I/O performance.md).

-   Allows you to enable or disable hyper-threading.

    **Note:** By default, Hyper-Threading is enabled on ECS instances. For more information, see [Customize CPU options](/intl.en-US/Instance/Manage instances/Customize CPU options.md).

-   Provides high network performance based on large computing capacity.
-   Suitable for the following scenarios:
    -   Scenarios such as on-screen video comments and telecom data forwarding where large volumes of packets are transmitted and received
    -   High-performance frontend server clusters
    -   Frontend servers of massively multiplayer online \(MMO\) games
    -   Data analysis, batch processing, and video encoding
