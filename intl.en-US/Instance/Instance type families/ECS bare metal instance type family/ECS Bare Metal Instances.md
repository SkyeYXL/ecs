## Overview

ECS Bare Metal Instance is a compute service that combines the elasticity of virtual machines and the performance and features of physical machines. ECS Bare Metal Instance is designed based on the state-of-the-art virtualization 2.0 technology developed by Alibaba Cloud. The virtualization 2.0 technology used by ECS Bare Metal Instance is optimized to support common ECS instances and nested virtualization. It maintains the elastic performance of ECS instances and the performance and features of physical machines.

ECS Bare Metal Instance combines the strengths of both physical machines and ECS instances to deliver powerful and robust computing capabilities. ECS Bare Metal Instance uses virtualization 2.0 to provide your business applications with direct access to the processor and memory resources of the underlying servers without virtualization overheads. ECS Bare Metal Instance retains the hardware feature sets \(such as Intel® VT-x\) and resource isolation capabilities of physical machines, which is ideal for applications that need to run in non-virtualization environments.

By virtue of the independently developed chips, hypervisor system software, and the redefined server hardware architecture, ECS Bare Metal Instance integrates features from both physical and virtual machines. ECS Bare Metal Instance can seamlessly connect with other Alibaba Cloud services for storage, networking, and database tasks. ECS Bare Metal Instance is fully compatible with ECS images. These properties allow you to build resources to suit your business requirements.

When you use ECS Bare Metal Instance, take note of the following items:

-   ECS Bare Metal Instance does not support instance type changes.
-   When the physical machine that hosts an ECS bare metal instance fails, the system fails the instance over to another physical machine. Data is retained within the data disks of the instance.

## Benefits

ECS Bare Metal Instance provides the following benefits based on technological innovations:

-   Exclusive computing resources

    As a cloud-based elastic computing service, ECS Bare Metal Instance delivers the same performance and resource isolation as standard physical machines and can ensure the exclusivity of computing resources without virtualization overheads or feature loss. ECS Bare Metal Instance supports 8, 32, 80, 96, or 104 vCPUs and high clock speeds. An ECS bare metal instance with eight vCPUs can provide a core frequency of 3.7 GHz to 4.1 GHz for better performance and faster response for gaming and finance businesses than peer services.

-   Chip-level security

    In addition to physical machine isolation, ECS Bare Metal Instance uses a chip-level trusted execution environment of Intel ® SGX to ensure that encrypted data can be computed only in a secure and trusted environment. This chip-level hardware security protection provides a safe box for your data in the cloud and allows you to control all data encryption and key protection processes. For more information, see [Install SGX](/intl.en-US/Instance/Instance type families/ECS bare metal instance type family/Install SGX.md).

-   Compatible with multiple private clouds

    ECS Bare Metal Instance can address the needs of high-performance computing and help you build new hybrid clouds. Thanks to the flexibility, elasticity, and other strengths inherited from the mix of physical and virtual machines, ECS Bare Metal Instance can implement re-virtualization. Offline private cloud business can be seamlessly migrated to Alibaba Cloud without performance overheads arising from nested virtualization, giving you a new method to move businesses onto the cloud.

-   Support for heterogeneous instruction set processors

    Virtualization 2.0 used by ECS Bare Metal Instance is developed independently by Alibaba Cloud, and supports instruction set processors such as ARM at no additional cost.


## Comparison of ECS bare metal instances, physical machines, and virtual machines
