# Create an instance by using the wizard

This topic describes how to create an ECS instance by using the wizard in the ECS console. To create an ECS instance, you must specify the instance type, image, storage, network, and security group. The wizard provides a variety of extended configuration features to meet your custom deployment and management requirements.

You must complete the following preparations to create an ECS instance:

1.  Create an account and complete the account information.
    -   Create an Alibaba Cloud account. For more information, see [Sign up with Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/50482.htm).
    -   Bind your credit card or PayPal account. For more information, see [Add a payment method](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/50517.htm).
    -   To purchase ECS instances in mainland China regions, you must complete real-name verification. For more information, see [Real-name registration FAQ](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/52595.htm).
2.  Alibaba Cloud provides a default VPC in each region. If you do not want to use the default VPC, you can create a VPC and a VSwitch in the region in which to create the instance. For more information, see [Create an IPv4 VPC network](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create an IPv4 VPC network.md).
3.  Alibaba Cloud provides a default security group in each region. If you do not want to use the default security group, you can create a security group in the region in which to create the instance. For more information, see [Create a security group](/intl.en-US/Security/Security groups/Create a security group.md).

If you need other extended features, you must complete corresponding preparations:

-   To specify an SSH key pair when you create a Linux instance, you must create the SSH key pair in the corresponding region. For more information, see [Create an SSH key pair](/intl.en-US/Security/Key pairs/Use an SSH key pair/Create an SSH key pair.md).
-   To add user data for the instance, you must first prepare user data. For more information about how to prepare user data, see [Prepare user data](/intl.en-US/Instance/Manage instances/User data/Prepare user data.md).
-   To associate an ECS instance with an instance RAM role, you must create the RAM role, attach permission policies to the role, and then bind the role to the instance. For more information, see [Bind an instance RAM role](/intl.en-US/Security/Instance RAM roles/Bind an instance RAM role.md).

1.  Go to the [Custom Launch](https://ecs-buy.aliyun.com/wizard/#/) tab in the ECS console.

2.  Perform the following operations in the Basic Configurations step:

    1.  Set **Billing Method** to **Subscription**, **Pay-As-You-Go**, or **Preemptible Instance**. For more information about preemptible instances, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Instance/Instance purchasing options/Preemptible instances/Overview.md).

        **Note:** For information about how to create a preemptible instance, see [Create a preemptible instance](/intl.en-US/Instance/Instance purchasing options/Preemptible instances/Create a preemptible instance.md).

    2.  Select a region and zone.

        By default, a zone is randomly assigned by the system. You can select a zone. For more information about regions and zones,see [Regions and zones](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/40654.htm).

        **Note:** You cannot change the region or zone after the instance is created.

    3.  Select an instance type and specify the number of instances.

        The instance types that are available are determined by the selected region. You can go to the [ECS Instance Types Available for Each Region](https://ecs-buy.aliyun.com/instanceTypes/#/instanceTypeByRegion) page to view the instance types available in each region. For information about the application scenarios for each instance type, see [Instance families](/intl.en-US/Instance/Instance families.md).

        **Note:**

        -   The quota of pay-as-you-go or preemptible instances for your account is displayed on the page.
        -   To use elastic network interfaces \(ENIs\), select an enterprise-level instance type equipped with at least two vCPUs or an entry-level instance type equipped with at least four vCPUs. For more information about the maximum number of ENIs that can be bound to an instance of each instance type, see [Instance families](/intl.en-US/Instance/Instance families.md).
        -   To use a standard SSD, select an I/O optimized instance.
    4.  Select an image. You can select a public image, a custom image, a shared image, or an Alibaba Cloud Marketplace image.

        **Note:**

        -   To use an SSH key pair, you must select a Linux image.
        -   To configure user data, you can select only specified images. For more information, see [Prepare user data](/intl.en-US/Instance/Manage instances/User data/Prepare user data.md).
        -   To use a Red Hat public image, make sure that the instance family supports Red Hat images. For more information, see the [Which instance families do Red Hat Enterprise Linux \(RHEL\) images support?](/intl.en-US/Images/Image FAQ.md) section in Image FAQ.
        -   Public images contain only initial system environments. You can find more images in Alibaba Cloud Marketplace.
    5.  Configure the storage.

        -   **System Disk**: required. You must create a system disk for the operating system. Select a disk category and specify the size for the system disk.
            -   Disk category: Categories are available based on the selected region and instance type.
            -   Size: The default size of the system disk is 40 GiB. If the selected image is greater than 40 GiB in size, the default size of the system disk is equal to the image size. The minimum size of the system disk is related to the image. The actual size is displayed on the buy page.

                |Image|System disk capacity \(GiB\)|
                |:----|:---------------------------|
                |Linux \(excluding CoreOS and Red Hat\)|\[max \{20, image size\}, 500\]|
                |FreeBSD|\[max \{30, image size\}, 500\]|
                |CoreOS|\[max \{30, image size\}, 500\]|
                |Red Hat|\[max \{40, image size\}, 500\]|
                |Windows|\[max \{40, image size\}, 500\]|

        -   **Data Disk**: optional. To create data disks for an instance while you are creating the instance, you must select the disk categories, and specify the sizes and quantity of the disks. You must also determine whether to encrypt the disks. For more information, see [Encryption overview](/intl.en-US/Block Storage/Encrypt a disk/Encryption overview.md). You can create an empty data disk or create a data disk from a snapshot. You can add up to 16 data disks.

            **Note:**

            A data disk that is created together with the instance has the following features:

            -   The billing method of the data disk is the same as that of the instance.
            -   Subscription data disks can be released only together with the instance to which they are attached. Pay-as-you-go data disks can be released either separately or together with the instance.
        -   **NAS File System**: optional. You can select from existing file systems. Up to five file systems can be specified. For more information, see [Mount a NAS file system when you purchase an ECS instance]().
        -   If you have selected an instance family equipped with local disks \(such as i1, d1, or d1ne\), the local disk information is displayed. You cannot specify the quantity or category of local disks because these settings depend on the selected instance type. For more information about the local disks that are supported by different instance types, see [Instance families](/intl.en-US/Instance/Instance families.md).
    6.  Configure the snapshot service. Select an automatic snapshot policy and set the data source to back up \(All Disks, Only System Disks, or Only Data Disks\).

        **Note:** You can use automatic snapshot policies to periodically back up disks to prevent risks such as virus attacks and accidental data deletion. The data source configured for the selected automatic snapshot policy includes only the disks created in the previous step. To back up subsequently created disks, you must apply automatic snapshot policies to them separately.

3.  Click **Next: Networking** and configure the network settings and security groups for the instance.

    1.  Select the network type.

        -   **VPC**: You must select a VPC and a VSwitch. If you do not have a VPC and a VSwitch, you can use the default ones.

            **Note:** Some instance families do not support advanced VPC features. For a list of these instance families, see [Instance families that do not support advanced VPC features](/intl.en-US/Instance/Instance families that do not support advanced VPC features.md). If you select an instance type from an instance family that does not support advanced VPC features and advanced features are enabled for a VPC, the VPC is dimmed and cannot be selected. You can move the pointer over the dimmed VPC to view the prompt, and reselect another instance type that supports the advanced VPC features based on the prompt.

        -   **Classic**: If you purchase an ECS instance for the first time after 12:00 on June 16, 2016 \(UTC+8\), you can no longer select the classic network.
    2.  Configure the public bandwidth.

        -   To assign a public IP address to the instance, you must select **Assign Public IP Address**. Then, select **Pay-By-Traffic** or **Pay-By-Bandwidth** as the billing method for network usage and specify the bandwidth. The public IP addresses assigned in this manner cannot be disassociated from the instance. For more information about the billing methods for network usage, see [Billing methods of public bandwidth](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing items/Billing methods of public bandwidth.md).
        -   If your instance does not need to access the Internet or your VPC-type instance uses an elastic IP address \(EIP\) to access the Internet, you do not need to assign a public IP address. You can associate an EIP with or disassociate an EIP from an instance at any time.
    3.  Select a security group.

        If you have not created a security group, you can use the default security group. For more information about rules of the default security group, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Security/Security groups/Overview.md).

    4.  Add an ENI.

        If the instance type that you selected supports ENIs, you can add an ENI and specify a VSwitch.

        **Note:** By default, the added ENI is released together with the instance. You can unbind the ENI from the instance by using the [ECS console](/intl.en-US/Network/Elastic Network Interfaces/Detach an ENI from an instance.md) or by calling the [DetachNetworkInterface](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Elastic network interfaces/DetachNetworkInterface.md) operation.

4.  Click **Next: System Configurations** and complete the following configurations:

    1.  Select and set logon credentials.

        Select a credential based on the image:

        -   Linux: You can select a password or an SSH key pair as the logon credential.
        -   Windows: You can select only a password as the logon credential.
        You can set the logon credential for an instance after the instance is created. For more information, see [Reset the logon password of an instance](/intl.en-US/Instance/Manage instances/Reset the logon password of an instance.md).

    2.  Specify the instance name that you want to display in the ECS console and the hostname that can be obtained from within the guest operating system.

    3.  Configure advanced options.

        -   RAM Role: Assign a RAM role to the instance.
        -   User Data: Customize the startup behavior of the instance or pass data into the instance.
5.  Click **Next: Grouping** and group the instance you have created.

    1.  Add tags.

        If you have multiple instances, you can use tags to facilitate management. For more information, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Tag & Resource/Tags/Overview.md).

    2.  Select a resource group.

        Resource groups are designed for enterprise users. Enterprise users can use this feature to organize and manage resources owned by multiple accounts and assigned to multiple projects. For more information, see [Resource groups](/intl.en-US/Tag & Resource/Resource/Resource groups.md).

    3.  Select a deployment set.

        Deployment sets are designed to manage the deployment of instances. Instances in the same deployment set can be assigned to different physical servers. This policy can ensure high availability of services and support the disaster recovery capability of the infrastructure. For more information, see [Create a deployment set](/intl.en-US/Elasticity/Deployment sets/Create a deployment set.md).

    4.  Select a dedicated host.

        You can select **Random DDH Supporting Automatic Deployment / AutoPlacement** or specify a dedicated host.

        Dedicated hosts are flexible and elastic and provide you with exclusive access to their resources. For more information, see [Features](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Features.md).

6.  Confirm the order.

    1.  In the **Configurations Selected** section, confirm all the configurations. You can also click the Edit icon to change the configurations.

        -   Optional. Click **Save as Launch Template** to save your configurations as a launch template that can be used later. For more information, see [Launch templates](/intl.en-US/Elasticity/Launch template/Launch templates.md).
        -   Optional. Click **View Open API** to view best-practice API scripts. On the left side of the dialog box, the **API Workflow** section describes the API operations related to the current operation and lists the request parameters and their values. Programming language-specific SDK examples are provided on the right side of the dialog box. Examples in **Java** and **Python** are available. For more information, see [Introduction](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Introduction.md).
        -   Optional. Click **Save as ROS Template** to save your configurations as a ROS template that can be used to create stacks. For more information, see [Create a stack](/intl.en-US/Stack management/Create a stack.md).
    2.  If the billing method is **Pay-As-You-Go**, you can select **Automatic Release**.

    3.  If the billing method is **Subscription**, you can specify the duration and specify whether to select **Enable Auto-renewal**.

    4.  Confirm the configuration fees.

        The following table lists the billing methods for instances and network usage that are used to calculate the fees you must pay.

        |Instance billing method|Billing method for network usage|Billed item|
        |:----------------------|:-------------------------------|:----------|
        |Pay-as-you-go or preemptible instance|Pay-by-traffic|Internet traffic fee and configuration fee. The configuration fee consists of fees for the instance type \(vCPUs and memory\), the system disk, data disks \(if any\), and local disks \(if any\).|
        |Pay-by-bandwidth|The configuration fee consists of fees for the instance type \(vCPUs and memory\), the system disk, data disks \(if any\), local disks \(if any\), and the public bandwidth.|
        |Subscription|Pay-by-bandwidth|The configuration fee consists of fees for the instance type \(vCPUs and memory\), the system disk, data disks \(if any\), local disks \(if any\), and the public bandwidth.|
        |Pay-by-traffic|Internet traffic fee and configuration fee. The configuration fee consists of fees for the instance type \(vCPUs and memory\), the system disk, data disks \(if any\), and local disks \(if any\).|

    5.  Read and select **ECS Terms of Service**.

7.  Confirm to create the instance.

    -   Subscription instance: Click **Create Order**.
    -   Pay-as-you-go instance: Click **Create Instance**.

After the instance is created, click **Console** to view the instance details in the ECS console. On the **Instances** page, you can view the information of the new instance, such as the instance name, public IP address, internal IP address, and private IP address.

-   You can build an FTP site on the ECS instance to upload local files to the instance. For more information, see [Manually build an FTP site on a Windows instance](/intl.en-US/Tutorials/Build an application/Build an FTP site on an ECS instance/Manually build an FTP site on a Windows instance.md).
-   To ensure the security of your instance after you create the instance, we recommend that you perform security compliance inspection and configuration:
