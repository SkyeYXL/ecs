# StartInstance

You can call this operation to start an ECS instance. After the operation is called, the instance enters the Starting state.

## Description

When you call this operation, take note of the following items:

-   The ECS instance to be started must be in the **Stopped** \(`Stopped`\) state.
-   If `OperationLocks` in the DescribeInstances response contains `"LockReason" : "security"` for an instance, the instance is locked for security reasons and cannot be started through calls to this operation. For more information, see [API behavior when an instance is locked for security reasons](~~25695~~).

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates the sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=Ecs&api=StartInstance&type=RPC&version=2014-05-26)

## Request parameters

|Parameter|Type|Required|Example|Description|
|---------|----|--------|-------|-----------|
|Action|String|Yes|StartInstance|The operation that you want to perform. Set the value to StartInstance. |
|InstanceId|String|Yes|i-bp67acfmxazb4p\*\*\*\*|The ID of the instance that you want to start. |
|InitLocalDisk|Boolean|No|true|Specifies whether to restore the instance to its initial health status. This parameter is applicable to instances of the instance families such as d1, i1, and i2 that are equipped with local disks. If a local disk of a d1, i1, or i2 instance fails, you can use this parameter to specify whether to restore the instance to its initial health status at startup. Default value: false. Valid values:

-   true: restores the instance to its initial health status at startup. After the instance is restored to its initial health status, data in the original local disks of the instance is lost.
-   false: does not perform any operations and keeps the instance in the current state. |
|DryRun|Boolean|No|true|Specifies whether to check the validity of the request without actually making the request. Default value: false. Valid values:

-   true: The validity of the request is checked but the request is not made. Check items include whether your AccessKey pair is valid, whether RAM users are authorized, and whether the required parameters are specified. If the check fails, the corresponding error is returned. If the check succeeds, the DryRunOperation error code is returned.
-   false: The validity of the request is checked. If the check succeeds, a 2XX HTTP status code is returned and the request is made. |

## Response parameters
