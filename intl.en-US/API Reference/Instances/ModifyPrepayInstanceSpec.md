# ModifyPrepayInstanceSpec

You can call this operation to upgrade or downgrade the instance type of a subscription ECS instance. The new instance type takes effect for the entire lifecycle of the instance.

## Description

Before you call this operation, make sure that you have fully understood the billing methods and pricing schedule of [ECS](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/ecs#pricing).

Before you change the instance type of a subscription instance, you can call the [DescribeResourcesModification](~~66187~~) operation to query the instance types to which you can change. For more information, see the Python SDK example in [Query available resources for configuration changes](~~109517~~).

When you call this operation, take note of the following items:

-   You cannot modify the instance type of an expired instance. You can renew the instance and try again.
-   When you downgrade the instance type of an instance, take note of the following items:
    -   The instance must be in the **Stopped** \(`Stopped`\) state.
    -   You must specify the operation type by setting `OperatorType` to downgrade.
    -   You can downgrade an instance for a maximum of three times. That is, the refund for the price difference cannot exceed three times. Downgrade operations include instance type downgrades, bandwidth downgrades, and the change of the disk billing method from subscription to pay-as-you-go.
    -   The price difference is refunded to the payment account you used. Price differences of coupon purchases are not refunded.
-   This operation is asynchronous and you must wait for about five to ten seconds for the instance type change to complete. Then, you must call the RebootInstance operation or restart the instance in the console to allow the instance type change to take effect. If you restart only the operating system, the change does not take effect.
    -   If the instance is in the **Stopped** state, you only need to start the instance. You do not need to restart the instance after it is in the Running state.
    -   If `RebootWhenFinished` is set to true for the instance, you do not need to manually restart the instance.

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates the sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=Ecs&api=ModifyPrepayInstanceSpec&type=RPC&version=2014-05-26)

## Request parameters

|Parameter|Type|Required|Example|Description|
|---------|----|--------|-------|-----------|
|Action|String|Yes|ModifyPrepayInstanceSpec|The operation that you want to perform. Set the value to ModifyPrepayInstanceSpec. |
|InstanceId|String|Yes|i-bp67acfmxazb4ph\*\*\*\*|The ID of the instance. |
|InstanceType|String|Yes|ecs.g5.xlarge|The new instance type. For information about available instance types, see [Instance families](~~25378~~) or call the [DescribeInstanceTypes](~~25620~~) operation. |
|RegionId|String|Yes|cn-hangzhou|The region ID of the instance. You can call the [DescribeRegions](~~25609~~) operation to query the most recent region list. |
|OperatorType|String|No|upgrade|The operation type. Default value: upgrade. Valid values:

-   upgrade: upgrades the instance type. Make sure that the balance in your payment account is sufficient.
-   downgrade: downgrades the instance type. When the new instance type specified by the `InstanceType` parameter is of lower specifications than the current instance type, you must set `OperatorType` to downgrade.

**Note:** For more information about the precautions on upgrading or downgrading instance types, see the preceding "Description" section in this topic. |
|ClientToken|String|No|123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000|The client token that is used to ensure the idempotence of the request. You can use the client to generate the value, but you must ensure that it is unique among different requests. The **ClientToken** value can only contain ASCII characters and cannot exceed 64 characters in length. For more information, see [How to ensure idempotence](~~25693~~). |
|AutoPay|Boolean|No|true|Specifies whether to enable automatic payment when you upgrade the instance type. Default value: true. Valid values:

-   true: Automatic payment is enabled.

**Note:** When your account balance is insufficient, your order will become invalid and you have to cancel this order. If your account balance is insufficient, you can set the `AutoPay` parameter to `false` to generate an unpaid order. Then, you can log on to the ECS console to complete the payment for the order.

-   false: An order is generated but no payment is made.

When `OperatorType` is set to `downgrade`, `AutoPay` is ignored. |
|MigrateAcrossZone|Boolean|No|false|Specifies whether to enable cross-cluster instance type upgrade.

Default value: false.

When the MigrateAcrossZone parameter is set to true and you upgrade the ECS instance based on the returned information, take note of the following items:

Classic network-type instances:

-   For retired instance types, when a non-I/O optimized instance is upgraded to an I/O optimized instance, the following items are modified: private IP address, disk device name, and software authorization code. For more information, see [Retired instance types](~~55263~~). For Linux instances, basic disks \(cloud\) are identified as xvda or xvdb. Ultra disks \(cloud\_efficiency\) and standard SSDs \(cloud\_ssd\) are identified as vda or vdb.
-   For available instance families, private IP addresses are modified after the instance types are upgraded. For more information, see [Instance families](~~25378~~).

VPC-type instances: For retired instance types, when a non-I/O optimized instance is upgraded to an I/O optimized instance, the following items are modified: disk device name and software authorization code. For Linux instances, basic disks \(cloud\) are identified as xvda or xvdb. Ultra disks \(cloud\_efficiency\) and standard SSDs \(cloud\_ssd\) are identified as vda or vdb. |
|SystemDisk.Category|String|No|cloud\_efficiency|The category of the system disk. This parameter is valid only when you upgrade an instance of a retired instance type to an instance type of an available instance family and upgrade a non-I/O optimized instance to an I/O optimized instance. For more information, see [Retired instance types](~~55263~~) and [Instance families](~~25378~~). Valid values:

-   cloud\_efficiency: ultra disk
-   cloud\_ssd: standard SSD |
|RebootTime|String|No|2018-01-01T12:05Z|The restart time of the instance. Specify the time in the [ISO 8601](~~25696~~) standard in the yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ format. The time must be in UTC. |
|EndTime|String|No|2018-01-01T12:05Z|The end time of the temporary change. Specify the time in the [ISO 8601](~~25696~~) standard in the yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ format. The time must be in UTC. |
|RebootWhenFinished|Boolean|No|false|Specifies whether to restart the instance immediately after the change of instance type is completed. Valid values:

Default value: false.

**Note:** If the instance is in the **Stopping** state, even if you set `RebootWhenFinished` to true, the instance status remains unchanged and no operations are performed. |

## Response parameters
