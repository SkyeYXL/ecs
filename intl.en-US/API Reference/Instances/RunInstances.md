# RunInstances

You can call this operation to create one or more pay-as-you-go or subscription ECS instances.

## Description

-   **Preparations**:
    -   Cost estimation: You have learned about the billing methods of ECS. For more information, see [Billing overview](~~25398~~).
    -   Instance type selection: You have called the [DescribeInstanceTypes](~~25620~~) operation to query the performance data of the instance types to which the instances to be created belong. For more information, see [Select instance types](~~58291~~).
    -   Available resource query: You have called the [DescribeAvailableResource](~~66186~~) operation to query instance availability in the specified region or zone.
    -   Network planning: You have created security groups. For more information, see [CreateSecurityGroup](~~25553~~). Before you create a VPC-type instance, create a VPC in the region where you want to create the instance. For more information, see [Create a VPC](~~65430~~).
-   **Precautions**:
    -   You can create a maximum of 100 instances at a time.
    -   You can use the `AutoReleaseTime` parameter to set the time when the instances are automatically released.
    -   After instances are created, the system returns the ID list of the created instances. You can call the [DescribeInstances](~~25506~~) operation to check the status of the instances.
    -   Instances automatically start after they are created. The instances are ready for use when they are in the `Running` state.
    -   Different from the [CreateInstance](~~25499~~) operation, the `RunInstances` operation enables the system to assign public IP addresses to the new instances if you set the `InternetMaxBandwidthOut` parameter to be greater than 0.
    -   After you call this operation, an error is returned if a parameter is invalid or available resources are insufficient. For more information, see the "Error codes" section in this topic.
-   **Best practices**:
    -   The `RunInstances` operation allows you to create multiple instances at a time. To better manage and search for these instances, we recommend that you specify the same tag pair by using the `Tag.N.Key` and `Tag.N.Value` parameters for the instances. You can also append sequential suffixes specified by the `UniqueSuffix` parameter to the hostnames specified by the `HostName` parameter and instance names specified by the `InstanceName` parameter.
    -   An instance launch template automatically specifies parameters that are required for creating an instance. You can call the [CreateLaunchTemplate](~~74686~~) operation to create an instance launch template. Then, in your request to call the `RunInstances` operation, specify the `LaunchTemplateId` and `LaunchTemplateVersion` parameters to use the launch template.
    -   In the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com/), you can view the best practices for calling the `RunInstances` operation when you create an ECS instance. On the Preview page, click View Open API in the Configurations Selected section. In the dialog box that appears, the left-side **API Workflow** section shows the operations and request parameters that are associated with the `RunInstances` operation. The right-side section shows the SDK examples in the **Java** or **Python** format.

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates a sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=Ecs&api=RunInstances&type=RPC&version=2014-05-26)

It must start with a letter and cannot start with http:// or https://. Default value: the `InstanceId` value.

**Note:** When you create multiple ECS instances, you can use `UniqueSuffix` to specify different instance names for the instances. You can also use the `name_prefix[begin_number,bits]name_suffix` format to name sequential instance names. For example, if you set `InstanceName` to `k8s-node-[1,4]-alibabacloud`, the instance name of the first ECS instance is `k8s-node-0001-alibabacloud`. For more information, see [API FAQ](~~122617#howToAddSequentialSuffix~~).

If you do not append suffixes to the instance names or hostnames by using the `name_suffix` format, but only use the `name_prefix[begin_number,bits]` format, the `UniqueSuffix` parameter is ignored.

-   For instances that run other operating systems such as Linux, the hostname must be 2 to 64 characters in length. You can use periods \(.\) to separate the hostname into multiple segments. Each segment can contain letters, digits, and hyphens \(-\).

**Note:** When you create multiple ECS instances, you can use the `UniqueSuffix` parameter to set different hostnames for these instances. You can also use the `name_prefix[begin_number,bits]name_suffix` format to name sequential hostnames. For example, if you set `HostName` to `k8s-node-[1,4]-ecshost`, the hostname of the first ECS instance is `k8s-node-0001-ecshost`. For more information, see [API FAQ](~~122617#howToAddSequentialSuffix~~).

-   false: Release protection is disabled for the instance.

**Note:** This parameter is applicable only to pay-as-you-go instances. It can protect instances only against manual releases, not against system releases. |
|Affinity|String|No|default|Specifies whether the instance on a dedicated host is associated with the dedicated host. Valid values:

-   default: The instance is not associated with the dedicated host. With the No Fees for Stopped Instances \(VPC-Connected\) feature enabled, when the instance is restarted after being stopped, it is automatically deployed to another dedicated host in the automatic deployment resource pool if the resources of original dedicated host are insufficient.
-   host: The instance is associated with the dedicated host. With the No Fees for Stopped Instances \(VPC-Connected\) feature enabled, when the instance is restarted after being stopped, it still resides on the original dedicated host. If the resources of the original dedicated host are insufficient, the instance will fail to be restarted.

Default value: default. |
|Tenancy|String|No|default|Specifies whether to create the instance on a dedicated host. Valid values:

-   default: creates the instance on a non-dedicated host.
-   host: creates the instance on a dedicated host. If you do not specify the `DedicatedHostId` parameter, Alibaba Cloud automatically selects a dedicated host for the instance.

|CpuOptions.Core|Integer|No|2|The number of CPU cores. This parameter cannot be specified but only uses its default value. |
|CpuOptions.ThreadsPerCore|Integer|No|2|The number of threads per core. The following formula is used to calculate the number of vCPUs of the ECS instance: `CpuOptions.Core` value × `CpuOptions.ThreadPerCore` value.

-   If the value of `CpuOptions.ThreadPerCore` is set to 1, CPU hyper-threads are disabled.
-   This parameter is applicable only to some instance types. |
|CpuOptions.Numa|String|No|1|The number of CPU Numa nodes. |
|HttpEndpoint|String|No|enabled|Specifies whether to enable the metadata endpoint on the instance. Valid values:
