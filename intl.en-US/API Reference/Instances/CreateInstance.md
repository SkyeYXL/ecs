# CreateInstance

You can call this operation to create a subscription or pay-as-you-go ECS instance.

## Description

**Note:** You can call the [DescribeAvailableResource](~~66186~~) operation to query available instance resources in a specified region or zone. If you want to create multiple instances at a time that automatically enter the Running state, we recommend that you call the [RunInstances](~~63440~~) operation.

When you create an ECS instance, take note of the following items:

-   **Billing method**:
    -   You must fully understand the ECS billing methods before you create an instance, because you may be charged for resources used by the instance. For more information, see [Billing overview](~~25398~~).
    -   If you create a subscription instance \(`PrePaid`\), available coupons in your account are used by default.
-   **Instance type**:
    -   You can use the `IoOptimized` parameter to specify whether to create an I/O optimized instance.
    -   Select an appropriate instance type. For the performance data about instance types, see [Instance families](~~25378~~) or call the [DescribeInstanceTypes](~~25620~~) operation. You can also see [Best practices for instance type selection](~~58291~~) to learn how to select instance types.
    -   Query available resources. You can call the [DescribeAvailableResource](~~66186~~) operation to query available resources in a specific region or zone.
-   **Image**:
    -   The image determines the system disk configurations of the instance. The system disk of the new instance is a clone of the specified image.
    -   If the instance memory size is 512 MiB, you cannot use Windows Server images except for Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel images.
    -   If the instance memory size is 4 GiB or larger, you cannot use 32-bit OS images.
-   **Network type**:
    -   Each VPC-type instance must be connected to one VSwitch.
    -   If `VSwitchId` is specified, the security group specified by `SecurityGroupId` and the VSwitch specified by `VSwitchId` must belong to the same VPC.
    -   `PrivateIpAddress` depends on `VSwitchId` and cannot be specified separately.`` If you specify both `VSwitchId` and `PrivateIpAddress`, the IP address specified in the `PrivateIpAddress` value must be available in the CIDR block of the specified VSwitch.
-   **Public bandwidth**:
    -   If you call the `CreateInstance` operation to create an instance, no public IP address is assigned to the instance. You can call the [AllocatePublicIpAddress](~~25544~~) operation to allocate public IP addresses manually.
    -   Bandwidth fees are determined based on the settings of `InternetChargeType` and `InternetMaxBandwidthOut`.
    -   The `InternetMaxBandwidthIn` value is irrelevant to billing because inbound data traffic is free of charge.
    -   If `InternetChargeType` is set to PayByBandwidth, `InternetMaxBandwidthOut` specifies a bandwidth value.
    -   If `InternetChargeType` is set to PayByTraffic, `InternetMaxBandwidthOut` specifies a peak bandwidth value. Actual fees are calculated based on the network traffic.
-   **Security group**:
    -   If no security group is available in the region where you want to create an instance, you must call the [CreateSecurityGroup](~~25553~~) operation to create a security group in that region first.
    -   The maximum number of instances that a security group can contain depends on the security group type. For more information, see the "Security group limits" section of the [Limits](~~25412~~) topic.
    -   Instances in the same security group can communicate with each other over the internal network. By default, instances in different security groups cannot communicate with each other. However, you can allow communication between instances by authorizing mutual access between their security groups. For more information, see [AuthorizeSecurityGroup](~~25554~~) and [AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress](~~25560~~).
-   **Storage**:
    -   The instance is assigned a system disk whose capacity is based on the image you specified. The capacity of the system disk must be at least `20 GiB and greater than or equal to the size of the image`. For more information about categories of system disks, see the description of the `SystemDisk.Category` parameter.
    -   When the system disk of an instance is a basic disk \(`cloud`\), an ultra disk \(`cloud_efficiency`\), or a standard SSD \(`cloud_ssd`\), the data disks of the instance cannot be local SSDs \(`ephemeral_ssd`\).
    -   The system disks of I/O optimized instances can only be ultra disks \(`cloud_efficiency`\) or standard SSDs \(`cloud_ssd`\).
    -   The maximum capacity of data disks varies with their categories. For more information, see the description of the `DataDisk.N.Size` parameter.
    -   A maximum of 16 data disks can be attached to each instance. The mount points of data disks are allocated by the system in alphabetical order from /dev/xvdb to /dev/xvdz.
    -   When data disks of an instance are local SSDs \(`ephemeral_ssd`\), the system disk of the instance must also be a local SSD. Excluding the system disk, the total capacity of local SSDs attached to an instance cannot exceed 1 TiB.
    -   Local SSDs \(`ephemeral_ssd`\) must be specified when you create instances and cannot be added after the instances are created.
-   **User data**: If the instance type supports [user data](~~49121~~), you can use the UserData parameter to pass in user data. User data is encoded in Base64. We recommend that you do not pass in confidential information such as passwords and private keys in plaintext. This is because the system does not encrypt `UserData` values when API requests are transferred. If you must pass in confidential information, we recommend that you encrypt and encode the user data in Base64, and then decode and decrypt it in the same way within the instance.
-   **Others**: When you call API operations by using Alibaba Cloud Command Line Interface \(CLI\) and SDKs, you must delete periods \(.\) from request parameters before you use them. For example, use `SystemDiskCategory` instead of `SystemDisk.Category` as a request parameter.

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates the sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=Ecs&api=CreateInstance&type=RPC&version=2014-05-26)
