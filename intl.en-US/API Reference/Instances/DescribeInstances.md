# DescribeInstances

You can call this operation to query details of one or more instances.

## Description

-   You can specify multiple request parameters. Specified parameters have logical AND relations. Only the specified parameters are included in the filter conditions. However, if InstanceIds is set to an empty JSON array, it is regarded as a valid filter condition and an empty result is returned.
-   If you are using a RAM user or RAM role, an empty list is returned when the user or the role has no permission to call this operation. You can add the `DryRun` parameter in your request to determine whether the empty list is caused by the lack of permission.

When you call an API operation by using Alibaba Cloud Command Line Interface \(CLI\), specify request parameter values of different data types in required formats. For more information, see [Parameter format overview](~~110340~~).

## Debugging
