# ReActivateInstances

You can call this operation to reactivate a pay-as-you-go instance that has expired or for which you have overdue payments.

## Description

When you call this operation, take note of the following items:

-   The instance must be in the **Expired** \(`Stopped`\) state.
-   You must pay the bills and reactivate the instance within 15 days after the instance is stopped due to overdue payments. If you fail to reactivate the instance within the preceding period, the instance is released and data on the instance cannot be recovered. If you cannot reactivate a VPC-type instance, try again later or [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ticket/createIndex).
-   After the operation is called, the instance enters the **Starting** \(`Starting`\) state.
-   You cannot call this operation on ECS instances that are locked for security reasons. An instance is locked for security reasons if `OperationLocks` in the response returned when you query information of the instance contains `"LockReason": "security"`. For more information, see [API behavior when an instance is locked for security reasons](~~25695~~).
