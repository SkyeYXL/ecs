# ModifyInstanceNetworkSpec

You can call this operation to modify the bandwidth configurations of an instance. You can modify the bandwidth configurations of an instance to improve network performance.

## Description

When you call this operation, take note of the following items:

-   When you modify the bandwidth configurations of a subscription \(PrePaid\) instance, a public IP address is automatically assigned to the instance if the outbound public bandwidth is upgraded from 0 Mbit/s \(InternetMaxBandwidthOut\).
-   When you modify the bandwidth configurations of a pay-as-you-go \(PostPaid\) instance, no public IP address is assigned to the instance if the outbound public bandwidth is upgraded from 0 Mbit/s \(InternetMaxBandwidthOut\). You must call the [AllocatePublicIpAddress](~~25544~~) operation to assign a public IP address to the instance.
-   For an instance in the classic network, the instance must be in the Stopped state when you upgrade its outbound public bandwidth \(InternetMaxBandwidthOut\) from 0 Mbit/s,.
-   After the bandwidth is upgraded, AutoPay is set to true by default. Make sure that you have sufficient balance in your account. Otherwise, your order becomes invalid and must be canceled. If your account balance is insufficient, you can set the AutoPay parameter to false to generate an unpaid order. Then, you can log on to the ECS console to pay for the order.
-   You can downgrade the public bandwidth of each subscription instance a maximum of three times. Therefore, a maximum of three refunds for price difference can be made.
-   The price difference is refunded to the payment account you used. Used coupons cannot be refunded.
-   Each time a modification of bandwidth configurations succeeds, you cannot modify the bandwidth of the instance again within five minutes.

|AllocatePublicIp|Boolean|No|false|Specifies whether to assign a public IP address.

Default value: false. |
|StartTime|String|No|2017-12-05T22:40Z|The start time of the temporary bandwidth upgrade. Specify the time in the [ISO 8601](~~25696~~) standard in the yyyy-MM-ddThh:mmZ format. The time must be in UTC and accurate to the **minute** \(mm\). |
|EndTime|String|No|2017-12-06T22Z|The end time of the temporary bandwidth upgrade. Specify the time in the [ISO 8601](~~25696~~) standard in the yyyy-MM-ddThhZ format. The time must be in UTC and accurate to the **hour** \(hh\). |
|AutoPay|Boolean|No|true|Specifies whether to enable automatic payment. Valid values:

-   true: Automatic payment is enabled. After the bandwidth configurations are upgraded, the payment is automatically made. Make sure that you have sufficient balance in your account when you set Autopay to true. If your account balance is insufficient, your order cannot be paid in the ECS console and becomes invalid. You have to cancel it.
-   false: Automatic payment is disabled. After the bandwidth configurations are upgraded, an order is generated but it is not paid. If your account balance is insufficient, you can set AutoPay to false to generate an unpaid order. Then, you can log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com) to pay for the order.

Default value: true. |
|ClientToken|String|No|123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000|The client token that is used to ensure the idempotence of the request. You can use the client to generate the value, but you must make sure that it is unique among different requests. The **ClientToken** value must contain only ASCII characters and cannot exceed 64 characters in length. For more information, see [How to ensure idempotence](~~25693~~). |
