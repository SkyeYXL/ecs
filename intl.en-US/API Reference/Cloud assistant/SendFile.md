# SendFile

You can call this operation to send a remote file to one or more ECS instances.

## Description:

-   The ECS instances to which to send a remote file must be in the Running \(`Running`\) state.
-   The Cloud Assistant client must be installed on the instances. For information about how to install the Cloud Assistant client, see [InstallCloudAssistant](~~85916~~).
-   The Cloud Assistant client can be used to send remote files only when its version is later than specific ones. If the `ClientNeedUpgrade` error code is returned, you must upgrade the Cloud Assistant client by following the instructions described in [Upgrade or disable upgrade of the Cloud Assistance client](~~134383~~).
    -   For Linux instances, the version of the Cloud Assistant client must be later than 1.0.2.569.
    -   For Windows instances, the version of the Cloud Assistant client must be later than 1.0.0.149.
-   The remote file to be sent must not exceed 32 KB in size after it is encoded in Base64.
-   The file may fail to be sent because of instance failures, network exceptions, or Cloud Assistance client failures. Call the [DescribeSendFileResults](~~~~) operation to find the failure causes.

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates the sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=Ecs&api=SendFile&type=RPC&version=2014-05-26)

## Request parameters

|Parameter|Type|Required|Example|Description|
|---------|----|--------|-------|-----------|
|Action|String|Yes|SendFile|The operation that you want to perform. Set the value to SendFile. |
|RegionId|String|Yes|cn-hangzhou|The region ID of the instance to which to send a remote file. You can call the [DescribeRegions](~~25609~~) operation to query the most recent region list. |
|Name|String|Yes|file.txt|The name of the remote file to be sent. The name must be 1 to 255 characters in length and can contain any characters. |
|InstanceId.N|RepeatList|Yes|i-bp185dy2o3o6n\*\*\*\*|The ID of instance N to which to send the remote file. A maximum of 50 instance IDs can be specified. Valid values of N: 1 to 50. |
|TargetDir|String|Yes|/home|The destination directory on the instance to which to send the remote file. If this parameter is not specified, the system automatically selects a directory on the instance. |
|Content|String|Yes|\#! /bin/bash echo "Current User is :" echo $\(ps \| grep "$$" \| awk '\{print $2\}'\) -------- oss://bucketName/objectName|The content of the remote file. The content must not exceed 32 KB in size after it is encoded in Base64.

-   If `ContentType` is set to `PlainText`, the Content value is a plaintext string.
-   If `ContentType` is set to `Base64`, the Content value is a Base64-encoded string. |
|Description|String|No|This is a test file.|The description of the remote file. The description must be 1 to 512 characters in length and can contain any characters. |
|ContentType|String|No|PlainText|The content type of the remote file.

-   PlainText
-   Base64

Default value: PlainText |
|Timeout|Long|No|60|The timeout period for sending the remote file. Unit: seconds.

-   A timeout error occurs if the file fails to be sent because of a process error, because a specific module does not exist, or because the Cloud Assistant client is not installed.
-   If the specified timeout period is less than 10 seconds, the system automatically sets the timeout period to 10 seconds to ensure that the file is sent to the instances.

Default value: 60. |
|FileOwner|String|No|root|The owner of the remote file. This parameter takes effect only on Linux instances. Default value: root. |
|FileGroup|String|No|root|The group of the remote file. This parameter takes effect only on Linux instances. Default value: root. |
|FileMode|String|No|0644|The permissions on the remote file. This parameter takes effect only on Linux instances. You can configure this parameter in the same way as you configure the chmod command.

Default value: 0644. This value indicates that the owner of the file has the read and write permissions on the file and that the group of the file and other users have only the read permission on the file. |
|Overwrite|Boolean|No|true|Specifies whether to overwrite a file in the destination directory if the file has the same name as the sent file.

-   true: overwrites the file.
