# AllocateDedicatedHosts

You can call this operation to create one or more pay-as-you-go or subscription dedicated hosts. A dedicated host is a physical server dedicated to a single tenant. You can create ECS instances on a dedicated host and view the attributes of the dedicated host.

## Description

Before you create a dedicated host, you can call the [DescribeAvailableResource](~~66186~~) operation to query the available resources in a specific region or zone.

We recommend that you understand the billing methods of resources before you create a dedicated host. You will be charged for resources used by the created dedicated host. For more information, see [Billing overview](~~68978~~).

-   You can create a maximum of 100 pay-as-you-go or subscription dedicated hosts at a time.
-   After a dedicated host is created, you can use its ID that is returned by the system as the value of a request parameter to call the [DescribeDedicatedHosts](~~134242~~) operation to query the status of the dedicated host.
-   After you submit a request to create a dedicated host, an error is returned if a specific parameter is invalid or the requested resources are insufficient. For more information about error reasons, see the Error codes section.
-   After a dedicated host is created, you can call the [ModifyInstanceDeployment](~~134248~~) operation to migrate ECS instances from a shared host to the dedicated host. You can also migrate ECS instances from another dedicated host to the created dedicated host.

## Request parameters

|Parameter|Type|Required|Example|Description|
|---------|----|--------|-------|-----------|
|Action|String|Yes|AllocateDedicatedHosts|The operation that you want to perform. Set the value to AllocateDedicatedHosts. |
|DedicatedHostType|String|Yes|ddh.c5|The dedicated host type. You can call the [DescribeDedicatedHostTypes](~~134240~~) operation to query the most recent list of dedicated host types. |
|RegionId|String|Yes|cn-hangzhou|The region ID of the dedicated host. You can call the [DescribeRegions](~~25609~~) operation to query the most recent region list. |
|Tag.N.Key|String|No|Environment|The key of tag N to be bound to the dedicated host. Valid values of N: 1 to 20.

The tag key cannot be an empty string. It can be up to 128 characters in length and cannot start with acs: or aliyun. It cannot contain http:// or https://. |
|Tag.N.Value|String|No|Production|The value of tag N to be bound to the dedicated host. Valid values of N: 1 to 20.

The tag value can be an empty string. It can be up to 128 characters in length and cannot start with acs: or contain http:// or https://. |
|ResourceGroupId|String|No|rg-bp67acfmxazb4ph\*\*\*|The ID of the resource group to which to assign the dedicated host. |
|ZoneId|String|No|cn-hangzhou-f|The zone ID of the dedicated host.

This parameter is empty by default. If you do not specify a zone, the system automatically selects a zone. |
|DedicatedHostName|String|No|myDDH|The name of the dedicated host. The name must be 2 to 128 characters in length and can contain letters, digits, colons \(:\), underscores \(\_\), and hyphens \(-\). It must start with a letter and cannot start with http:// or https://. |
|DedicatedHostClusterId|String|No|dc-bp12wlf6am0vz9v2\*\*\*\*|The ID of the dedicated host cluster to which to assign the dedicated host. |
|ActionOnMaintenance|String|No|Migrate|The policy used to migrate the instances deployed on the dedicated host when the dedicated host fails or needs to be repaired online. Valid values:

-   Migrate: The instances are migrated to another physical server and restarted.

If the dedicated host is attached with cloud disks, the default value is Migrate.

-   Stop: The instances are stopped. If the dedicated host cannot be repaired, the instances are migrated to another physical server and restarted.

If the dedicated host is attached with local disks, the default value is Stop. |
|NetworkAttributes.SlbUdpTimeout|Integer|No|60|The timeout period for a UDP session between Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) and the dedicated host. Unit: seconds. Valid values: 15 to 310. |
|NetworkAttributes.UdpTimeout|Integer|No|60|The timeout period for a UDP session between a user and an Alibaba Cloud service on the dedicated host. Unit: seconds. Valid values: 15 to 310. |
|Description|String|No|This-is-my-DDH|The description of the dedicated host. The description must be 2 to 256 characters in length and cannot start with http:// or https://. |
|AutoPlacement|String|No|off|Specifies whether to add the dedicated host to the resource pool for automatic deployment. If you create an ECS instance on a dedicated host without specifying the **DedicatedHostId** parameter, Alibaba Cloud automatically selects a dedicated host from the resource pool to host the instance. For more information, see [Automatic deployment](~~118938~~). Valid values:

-   on: adds the dedicated host to the resource pool for automatic deployment.
-   off: does not add the dedicated host to the resource pool for automatic deployment.

Default value: on.

**Note:** If you do not want to add the dedicated host to the resource pool for automatic deployment, set the value to off. |
|CpuOverCommitRatio|Float|No|1|The CPU overcommit ratio. You can configure CPU overcommit ratios for only the following dedicated host types: g6s, c6s, and r6s. Valid values: 1 to 5.

The CPU overcommit ratio affects the number of available vCPUs on a dedicated host. You can use the following formula to calculate the number of available vCPUs on a dedicated host: Number of available vCPUs = Number of physical CPU cores × 2 × CPU overcommit ratio. For example, the number of physical CPU cores on each g6s dedicated host is 52. If you change the CPU overcommit ratio of a g6s dedicated host to 4, the number of available vCPUs on the dedicated host is 416. For scenarios that have minimal requirements on CPU stability or where CPU load is not heavy such as development and test environments, you can increase the number of available vCPUs on a dedicated host by increasing the CPU overcommit ratio. This way, you can deploy more ECS instances of the same specifications on the dedicated host and reduce the unit deployment cost. |
|ChargeType|String|No|PrePaid|The billing method of the dedicated host. Default value: PostPaid. Valid values:

-   PrePaid: subscription. If you set this parameter to PrePaid, make sure that you have sufficient account balance or credit. Otherwise, InvalidPayMethod is returned.
-   PostPaid: pay-as-you-go. |
|Quantity|Integer|No|1|The number of dedicated hosts that you want to create. Valid values: 1 to 100.

Default: 1. |
|Period|Integer|No|6|The subscription period of the dedicated host. The `Period` parameter takes effect and is required only when the `ChargeType` parameter is set to `PrePaid`. Valid values:

-   If the PeriodUnit parameter is set to Month, valid values of Period are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
-   If the PeriodUnit parameter is set to Year, valid values of Period are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. |
|PeriodUnit|String|No|Month|The unit of the subscription period of the dedicated host. Valid values:

-   Month
-   Year

Default value: Month. |
|AutoRenew|Boolean|No|false|Specifies whether to automatically renew the subscription dedicated host.

**Note:** The **AutoRenew** parameter takes effect only when the **ChargeType** parameter is set to PrePaid.

Default value: false. |
|AutoRenewPeriod|Integer|No|1|The auto-renewal period of the dedicated host. Unit: months. Valid values: 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12.

**Note:** The **AutoRenewPeriod** parameter takes effect and is required only when the **AutoRenew** parameter is set to true. |
|AutoReleaseTime|String|No|2019-08-21T12:30:24Z|The automatic release time of the dedicated host. Specify the time in the ISO 8601 standard in the yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ format. The time must be in UTC.

**Note:**

-   It must be at least half an hour later than the current time.
-   It must be at most three years later than the current time.
-   If the value of the seconds \(ss\) is not 00, it is automatically set to 00. |
|ClientToken|String|No|123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000|The client token that is used to ensure the idempotence of the request.
