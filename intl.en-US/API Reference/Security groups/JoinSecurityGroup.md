# JoinSecurityGroup

You can call this operation to add an ECS instance to a security group.

## Description

**Note:** This operation is not recommended. We recommend that you call the [ModifyInstanceAttribute](~~25503~~) operation to add or remove ECS instances to or from a security group, and call the [ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute](~~58513~~) operation to add or remove elastic network interfaces \(ENIs\) to or from a security group.

When you call this operation, take note of the following items:

-   Before you add an instance to a security group, the instance must be in the **Stopped** \(Stopped\) or **Running** \(Running\) state.
-   An instance can be added to a maximum of five security groups.
-   You can [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ticket/createIndex) to add an instance to more security groups. An instance can be added to a maximum of 16 security groups.
-   A basic security group can contain a maximum of 2,000 instances. An advanced security group can contain a maximum of 65,536 instances.
-   The security group and the instance must belong to the same region.
-   The security group and the instance must be of the same network type. If the network type is VPC, the security group and the instance must be in the same VPC.
