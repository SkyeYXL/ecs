# Overview

This topic provides an overview of public images provided by Alibaba Cloud, including Alibaba Cloud Linux images, third-party images, and open source images. The public images are fully licensed to provide a secure and stable operating environment for applications on ECS instances.

## Types of public images

The following table describes two types of public images provided by Alibaba Cloud. Windows Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux images cannot be used free of charge. However, you can use other free public images to create ECS instances. For more information, see [Image overview](/intl.en-US/Images/Image overview.md).

|Type|Description|Technical support|
|:---|:----------|:----------------|
|Alibaba Cloud Linux images|Alibaba Cloud Linux images are custom, proprietary operating systems provided by Alibaba Cloud to create ECS instances. Alibaba Cloud Linux images are fully tested to guarantee their security, stability, and normal startup and operation.|Alibaba Cloud provides technical support for problems that occur when you use Alibaba Cloud Linux images.|
|Third-party images and open source images|Third-party and open source images are fully tested and released by Alibaba Cloud to guarantee their security, stability, and normal startup and operation. Such images include: -   Windows: Windows Server
-   Linux: Ubuntu, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, OpenSUSE, SUSE Linux, FreeBSD, and CoreOS

|We recommend that you contact the corresponding operating system vendors or open source communities for technical support. Alibaba Cloud also provides information about image- and system-related problems.|

## Alibaba Cloud Linux images

Alibaba Cloud Linux is a Linux public image developed by Alibaba Cloud. The following table describes the versions of Alibaba Cloud Linux images.

|Operating system|Version|Description|

|A next-generation operating system that supports various Alibaba Cloud instance types including ECS Bare Metal Instance Types. By default, Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 is also equipped with [Alibaba Cloud CLI]() and other software packages.

If you want to replace other Linux distributions with Alibaba Cloud Linux 2, you can select Public Image and then Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 when you create an ECS instance or when you replace the system disk of an ECS instance.

For more information, see [Overview of Alibaba Cloud Linux 2](/intl.en-US/Images/Alibaba Cloud Linux 2/Overview of Alibaba Cloud Linux 2.md) and [Release notes of Alibaba Cloud Linux 2](/intl.en-US/Images/Alibaba Cloud Linux 2/Release notes of Alibaba Cloud Linux 2.md). |

## Third-party images and open source images

Alibaba Cloud releases and updates public images of third-party and open source image vendors on a regular basis. For more information, see [Release notes](/intl.en-US/Images/Public image/Release notes.md). In the ECS console, you can select a region and view all the public images available in that region on the [Public Images](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com/#image/region/cn-hangzhou/systemImageList) tab. For more information, see [Find an image](/intl.en-US/Images/Find an image.md).

The following tables describe the versions of third-party and open source public images for Windows and Linux provided by Alibaba Cloud.
