# Vulnerability announcements \| Zero-day vulnerabilities in VM escape

At the 8th Internet Security Conference 2020 \(ISC 2020\), the zero-day vulnerabilities in QEMU/KVM VM escape were publicized. Zero-day vulnerabilities in VM escape can be exploited to read and write unauthorized data up to 0xffffffff \(that is 4 GB in size\) from a heap and enable a complete VM escape. Alibaba Cloud has fixed these vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability information

At the ISC 2020 held on August 13th, the vulnerabilities were publicized. Zero-day vulnerabilities in VM escape can be exploited to read and write unauthorized data up to 0xffffffff \(that is 4 GB in size\) from a heap and enable a complete VM escape. Code can then be executed in the host and result in serious information leaks. So far, QEMU has not provided any official patches for the vulnerabilities.
